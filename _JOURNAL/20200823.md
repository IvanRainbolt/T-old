I am starting my software discovery by creating a new C# Blazor UI project. 
Turn this into a git repository.
Add the `_Journal` directory.

Then adding another F# command project, ==NOT PART OF THE TApp SOLUTION==, for the [Canopy](https://lefthandedgoat.github.io/canopy/) _tests_. 

INSIGHT
:  Canopy tests _can_ be setup with `[Fact]` like XUnit. If you want to use the cool flow syntax like all the examples found show, it needs to run not in VS test runner. Instead, as a command line tool. In order for Canopy to operate, it also needs the website available, as in it running in the dev IIS already. 

: So by have the canopy tests in its own command line project, I can F5 the dev solution, then run the canopy command program in a different instance of VS and hit the IIS that is service the dev project. 

I used the instructions [here](https://www.olivercoding.com/2018-06-29-canopy/) to see this [Fact] method. I was able to get it working and run the tests in the VS test runner with somewhat success. My problem is that this way is not the _cool_ way I always see Canopy used. The test runner is also accessing websites already running, not my local VS the dev server.  

After a lot of tinkering, I have been able to distill down a very minimal working Canopy setup. The [ch9 video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/NET-Fringe/NET-Fringe-2015/Web-UI-Testing-with-F-and-Canopy) with [Amir Rajan](https://github.com/amirrajan) showing how to build the [script](https://github.com/amirrajan/canopy-demo) with f# interactive was quite inspiring.

My findings are that I can have an F# console app in the project. It can run as the .exe if the dev or target server is running. I can also use .fsx script files and use F# Interactive live the be able to create scripts to run. 

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is quite a bit to take in and use. Canopy is quite advanced. All the resources related to it assume one to be quite good with F#, Selenium, testing and UI testing already. Props to lefthandedgoat, he is obviously a master at these things. For lowest level people like myself, I am spending a whole of time trying to get a basic usage figured out. 

One note I have is that the examples tend to have several actions but are in 1 test. This is something I will have to explore. 

My intended usage is to hybrid the Event Modeling, specification, design,  documentation and TDD loop using canopy. The Gerkin BDD should fit in here soon as well as I move forward.
